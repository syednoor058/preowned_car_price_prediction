# Pre-Owned Car Price Prediction

Welcome to the Pre-Owned Car Price Prediction project! This project is designed to help you predict the price of a pre-owned car based on various factors such as age, mileage, body type, brand, model, color, odometer reading, and more. It employs ten popular machine learning models to provide accurate price estimates.

## Features

- **Price Prediction**: Input the car's details, and the system will estimate its price based on machine learning models.

- **Model Diversity**: This project implements ten diverse machine learning models to ensure comprehensive price predictions.

- **Data Insights**: Gain insights into how various factors affect a car's price, which can be useful for both buyers and sellers.
